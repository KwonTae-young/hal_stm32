Status:
   version 1.0.0

Purpose:
   This library is used on stm32wb series to enable HCI communication between
   a host BLE running on CM-4 STM32WB core and a controller BLE firmware running
   on CM-0 core.

Description:
   This library provides an API for shared RAM communication with BLE controller
   firmware running on STM32WB C-M0 core.

Dependencies:
   This library depends on STM32Cube IPCC HAL API.
   It is available in ext/hal/st/stm32cube/stm32wbxx/drivers

        * Remove use of useless section SYSTEM_DRIVER_CONTEXT
            Section has no use. Remove it.
          Impacted file: shci_tl.c

        * Inform C-M0 that BLE host should not be used.
            In case C-M0 binary includes BLE Host, inform that it should not be
            used as, in Zephyr context, it is  running on C-M4 side.
